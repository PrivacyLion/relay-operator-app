## Contributor Rewards

We believe in rewarding valuable open-source contributions. If your pull request is merged into the main product, you will receive a share of the BTC project revenue as follows:

### Rewards Model

- Each quarter, the project owner will review all pull requests merged since the last review.
- The top 3 PRs will be selected based on impact, usefulness, and quality.
- A public vote among contributors (excluding the PR authors) will confirm the selections.
- The author that wins the majority vote will receive a BTC payout as a percentage of project revenue for that quarter.

### Eligibility

- Only PRs merged into the `master` branch are eligible.
- Contributors must provide a valid BTC address for rewards.
- Rewards will be paid out via BTC on-chain or Lightning Network.

### Notes

- The reward system is subject to change as the project grows.
- For questions, open an issue or email the project owner.

Thank you for making this project better!
