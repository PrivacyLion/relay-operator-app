# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Privacy Lion LLC's open-source projects.

To clarify the legal terms under which your contributions will be made, you must agree to the following Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") before submitting any code, documentation, or other content ("Contributions").

## 1. Grant of License

By submitting a Contribution to this project, you grant Privacy Lion LLC a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and create derivative works of the Contribution, in both source and object form, under any license, including but not limited to the Elastic License 2.0 and future Apache 2.0 license.

## 2. You Confirm That:

- You have the legal right to make the Contribution.
- You are the original author of the code, or you have permission from the copyright holder.
- Your Contribution does not include confidential, proprietary, or third-party material without the appropriate license.
- Your Contribution is intentionally provided to Privacy Lion LLC for inclusion in its open-source projects and may be licensed and distributed as part of those projects.

## 3. No Obligation

This agreement does not require Privacy Lion LLC to include your Contribution in any project. We may reject, modify, or remove Contributions at our discretion.

## 4. No Compensation or Ownership

Contributing does not make you an employee, partner, agent, or affiliate of Privacy Lion LLC. You are not entitled to compensation or royalties unless otherwise stated in a separate written agreement or covered by the `REWARDS.md` profit-sharing model (if available).

## 5. Future License Transitions

Privacy Lion LLC reserves the right to relicense the project (e.g., to Apache 2.0) at a later date. This CLA ensures that your Contributions may be included under such future licensing transitions without requiring further approval.
